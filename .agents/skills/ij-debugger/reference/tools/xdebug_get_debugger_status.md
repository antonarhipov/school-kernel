# xdebug_get_debugger_status
Pass `sessionId` to query one active or retained session directly.<br/><br/>Preconditions:<br/>- None.<br/><br/>Without `sessionId`, returns active sessions followed by the five most recent stopped sessions.<br/><br/>Next call:<br/>- If no sessions are running, call `xdebug_start_debugger_session`.<br/>- If multiple sessions are active, use the returned `sessionId` in subsequent calls.
