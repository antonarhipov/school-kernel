# xdebug_get_frame_values
Use this tool to inspect local variables, parameters, and fields or other values available at a specific point in the call stack.<br/><br/>Preconditions:<br/>- Session must be suspended.<br/>- Frame index should come from the current paused `xdebug_get_stack` result.<br/><br/>Format:<br/>- Nodes that have children are marked with `+`.<br/><br/>Next call:<br/>- Use `xdebug_get_value_by_path` to drill into nested fields.<br/>- Use `xdebug_evaluate_expression` for computed checks in the same frame.<br/>- Do not reuse a cached `frameIndex` after `RESUME`, `STEP_*`, `xdebug_run_to_line`, or any change in paused location.

## Parameters
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sessionId | string | Debug session ID. Use the current ID returned by `xdebug_get_debugger_status` or `xdebug_start_debugger_session`. The ID remains stable after the session stops. Active-only operations return `SESSION_NOT_ACTIVE` for retained stopped sessions. If null and exactly one active session exists, it is selected automatically. If multiple sessions are active and sessionId is omitted, the call fails. Default: null. |
| frameIndex | integer | Stack frame index counted from the top of the stack, the same `index` `xdebug_get_stack` reports: 0 is the frame execution is in, 1 its caller, and so on. Obtain this from the current paused `xdebug_get_stack` result; do not reuse a cached frame index after `RESUME`, `STEP_*`, `xdebug_run_to_line`, or any change in paused location. If null, uses the frame currently selected in the debugger, the one `xdebug_get_stack` marks `isCurrent`. Default: null. |
| depth | integer | Maximum depth for expanding nested objects (0 = no children (only frame variables), 1 = variables with first level children, 2 = two levels of children, etc.). Default: 0. |
| projectPath | string | The project path. Pass this value ALWAYS if you are aware of it. It reduces numbers of ambiguous calls. <br/>In the case you know only the current working directory you can use it as the project path.<br/>If you're not aware about the project path you can ask user about it. |
